- Hello-World!
- My First One.
- I’m @DodoM2023.
- New to this. And that is being polite. Spent the last 25+ years in a completely different field. Needed to make a change and quite literally stumbled into this. Was not on my radar at all. Once I started though I could not stop. And still haven't.
- Currently I'm doing the CS50X,P, and W routes and trying to utilize any other programs I can get my hands on.
- I’m looking to continue moving forward, soaking in anything and everything I can until I commit to a role I want to focus on and pursue.
